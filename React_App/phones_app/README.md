# Phone List

Phone list is the project of my Tech Challenge. In it you can view a list of phones and also click on the "Details" button to see the details of the model.
For this it was created the API that returns the list of phones and the APP that shows in the browser.

## How to Run

To run my project you must first start my API.
Go to the path "API/phonesAPI" and run the command "npm run dev" in the console.
With the API running, you must go to the path "React_App/phones_app" and run the command "npm start" in the console.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
