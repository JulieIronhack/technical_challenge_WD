  At The Phone Cave we are looking for someone to help us turn our cave store into a home, and to do so we present you this challenge.

You can find a README file in each section.

## How to make it work
This is a Node app that uses Express. In order to make it work, please use "npm run dev".

### Routes

| Route                 | HTTP Verb | Description    |

| `/phones`             | GET       | Show all phones (use the `phones.json`) as fake data |

#### What is the app about?
This is a simple app displaying a list of available phones. When you click on any phone of your interest, the details will display before you: brand, image, description and price.
