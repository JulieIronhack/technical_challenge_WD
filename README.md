## Installation

Its necesary to install all the dependencies using npm package manager for both folders: client and server.

```bash
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies you have to run both in your localhost

### Server
http://localhost:5005
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Client
http://localhost:3000
```bash
npm start
```

### End points

| Route                             | HTTP Verb | Description    |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `http://localhost:5005/phones`    | GET       | Show all phones |
| `http://localhost:5005/phones/:id`| GET       | Show a phone details|

In the React App page you only need to click a phone and after that it will show the details about the phone
