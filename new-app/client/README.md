##Phone List

This app is the resolt of my tech challenge.
Were you can see a list of phones and when you click the in one phone name we show all the details of that phone.

#Frist Iteration

Do an API REST with NodeJS that meets the following requirements:

- One endpoint / telephones
- Return the data "phones.json"

#Second Iteration

Do a React application that shows the API we created before. We works with hooks.

##How to Run

To run this project you need to start first run the API. In the server folder on command console you run: "npm run dev".
Next, you open the folder client and run the code: "npm start" on the command console, this opens a tab on your browser with the app.
