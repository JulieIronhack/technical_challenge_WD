# How to use

## First steps
- run npm install 
- run npm i react-router-dom

## How to run both sides 

In order to run the server side, make sure to run npm instal and on the console, run the code in the terminal 

    $ npm run dev 


In order to run the client side of the project (react), again make sure to install all the dependencies and  run the code in the terminal

    $ npm start 

this app is using the ports localhost:5005 fopr the server side and localhost:3000 for the client(react) side. if this ports are already in use, the terminal should give the option to use another port, or you may change the ports on the .env files in each folder to your liking.
