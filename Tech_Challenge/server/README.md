# The Phone Cave (WD) Server-Side

  This is a Tech Challenge where I had to build an API to be used from the frontend to get information about the phones details.

  ## Setup
  - Clone this repo
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
  ## REST API 

| Route                 | HTTP Verb | Description    |
| --------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| `/phones`             | GET       | Show all phones     |
| `/phones/:id`         | GET       | Show a phone details|
